Q1.3)
Answer:
I think A* search is a good enough approach for this game. 
Since this is a only 3 by 3 board game, the search space won't be too big.
Also, it is likely to enter a loop or cycle, therefore, we can not use DFS.
By giving a good heuristic function, the program should be able to determine
when to play defensively (usually only one option) or aggresively (need to 
find out which move can lead to a goal or closer to a goal).
