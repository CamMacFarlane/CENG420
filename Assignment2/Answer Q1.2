Distance function for Pizzas:
We can predefine the weights of each attribute based on our own knowledge for example:
Recipe 	  35%
Sauce 		20%
Toppings 	10%
Size 		  10%
Crust type 	10%
Shape 		10%
Price 		0%
Producer 	5%

Calcualtions:

Recipe:	 (Xsteps ∩ Ysteps)  /  Max (Count(Xsteps), Count(Ysteps))
 
 
Sauce: 	 (Xsauces ∩ Ysauces)  /  Max (Count(Xsauces), Count(Ysauces))
 
 
Toppings: 	(Xtoppings ∩ Ytoppings)  /  Max (Count(Xtoppings), Count(Ytoppings))
 
 
Size:		1- (Max(Xsize,Ysize) - Min(Xsize,Ysize))/ Min(Xsize,Ysize))
 
 
Crust type:	1 if they are the same, 0 otherwise
 
 
shape :	1 if they are the same (either round or rectangle), 0 otherwise
 
 
Producer: 	1 if they are the same, 0 otherwise
 
 
The distance function returns the sum of the above calculations.
 
4. Define the overfitting and underfitting problems for feature selection, and give one example for each that will cause these problems
